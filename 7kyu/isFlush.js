// Determine if the poker hand is flush, meaning if the five cards are of the same suit.

// Your function will be passed a list/array of 5 strings, each representing a poker card in the format "5H" (5 of hearts), meaning the value of the card followed by the initial of its suit (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds or Clubs). No jokers included.

// Your function should return true if the hand is a flush, false otherwise.

// The possible card values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
