//DESCRIPTION:
// Gordon Ramsay shouts. He shouts and swears. There may be something wrong with him.

// Anyway, you will be given a string of four words. Your job is to turn them in to Gordon language.

// Rules:

// Obviously the words should be Caps, Every word should end with '!!!!', Any letter 'a' or 'A' should become '@', Any other vowel should become '*'.



function gordon(a){
  return a.toUpperCase().replace(/A/g, '@').replace(/[aeiou]/ig, '*').split(' ').join('!!!! ')+'!!!!'
}
