// Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a filtered list containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

// The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

//   ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]
// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

//  ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]
// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]




function gooseFilter (birds) {
  var geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
 
  return birds.filter(words => !geese.includes(words))
};
