// If you've completed this kata already and want a bigger challenge, here's the 3D version

// Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.

// There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.



const flip=(d, a)=>{
  if(d === 'R'){
    return a.sort((b,c) => b - c)
  }else if(d === 'L'){
    return a.sort((b,c) => c - b)
  } 
}
